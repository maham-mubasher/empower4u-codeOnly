        Rare neurological conditions, such as Huntingtonâ€™s disease, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), and various neuromuscular diseases, can lead to progressive physical and cognitive impairments. These conditions affect muscle control, movement, coordination, and often speech, gradually reducing a person's ability to perform everyday tasks independently. The progressive nature of these diseases also places significant emotional and physical strain on both patients and their caregivers, often requiring long-term care and support.        </p>
