          There are two main types of stroke: ischemic and hemorrhagic. Both types result in damage to brain cells, leading to various impairments depending on the area affected. A stroke can significantly impair a patientâ€™s mobility, speech, and cognitive abilities, impacting their ability to perform daily tasks independently. This often places a heavy emotional and physical burden on caregivers, as they may need to provide constant support and assistance with basic activities, leading to stress and fatigue.
