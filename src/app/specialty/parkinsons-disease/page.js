          Parkinson&#39;s disease is a progressive neurological disorder that affects movement, muscle control, and balance due to the loss of dopamine-producing cells in the brain. Common symptoms include tremors, rigidity, bradykinesia (slowness of movement), and postural instability, all of which can significantly impact a person&#39;s ability to carry out daily tasks independently. Over time, the challenges of living with Parkinson&#39;s can also place a strain on caregivers, who may need to assist with activities such as walking, dressing, and mobility, leading to emotional and physical exhaustion.
